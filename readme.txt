== Description ==

The Crawl Optimization Plugin is designed to help optimize your website’s crawl rate by removing unnecessary links and information from your HTTP headers. By deactivating elements such as shortlinks, REST API links, RSD/WLW links, oEmbed links, generator tags, and X-Pingback headers, this plugin streamlines the navigation of your website and reduces the amount of data transferred.
